  "tagline": "The implementation of a TSM Face Detection System in C++",
  "body": "###Abstract\r\nThis page is referred to the custom implementation in C++ of a Tree Structure Model (TSM) face detection, pose estimation and landmark localization system based on the [“Face Detection, Pose Estimation, and Landmark Localization in the Wild”](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~xzhu/face/) system by [Xiangxin Zhu](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~xzhu/) and [Deva Ramanan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/). This implementation was developed by [Panos Kalodimas](https://gr.linkedin.com/in/pkalodimas) as its master thesis for the [Technical University of Crete](http://www.tuc.gr), Chania, Greece. More details about the master thesis can be found in the [master thesis web page](https://pkalodimas.github.io/Master-Thesis/).\r\n\r\n###Documentation\r\nAs this implementation is a part of a master thesis, the full documentation can be found in the [master thesis main page](https://pkalodimas.github.io/Master-Thesis/). The TSM system user manual can be found in the [documentation folder](https://github.com/pkalodimas/TSM-Face-Detector-CPP/tree/documentation/documentation).\r\n\r\n###Implementation\r\nThis implementation of the TSM face detection system is implemented in C++. The default version used is the version 3.2.2 as described in the master thesis documentation. The version 2.2.2 is also available by changing the settings file as is described in the TSM system user manual. All the other versions described in the master thesis documentation are implemented in basic C and can be found in the [basic C implementation page]( https://pkalodimas.github.io/TSM-Face-Detection-C/).\r\n",
